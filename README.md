# Socket-Programming
This Java code repository provides a comprehensive solution for implementing socket programming to facilitate efficient file transfers between two hosts. The main objective of this project is to establish a reliable and secure method for exchanging files, enabling seamless communication between client and server applications.

Key Features:

Socket-based communication: Utilize Java sockets to establish a connection between the client and server, enabling bidirectional data transmission.
File transfer functionality: Implement robust file transfer mechanisms to ensure efficient and reliable exchange of files between the two hosts.
Error handling and data integrity: Incorporate error detection and correction techniques to ensure the integrity and accuracy of transferred files.
Progress tracking: Enable real-time tracking of file transfer progress, providing users with visual feedback on the ongoing operation.
Security considerations: Implement necessary security measures to protect the confidentiality and authenticity of the transmitted files.
